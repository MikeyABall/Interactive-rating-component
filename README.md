## Overview

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor]. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

- Began with layout and styling as per the design.
- Kept in mind that part of main will be hidden until Javascript flips them.
- Wrote Javascript code to handle the main change and track which rating was picked then submitted.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was a great challenge for me to utilize simple DOM manipulation for the first time in an actual project. Some of the design aspects caught me for a few moments but I was able to overcome and get the challenge done. At first I was overthinking the script way too much but after giving it some thought I think I was able to come up with a good solution.

### Continued development

In the future I want to continue with ensuring I have streamlined code and improving that. I truly enjoy thinking about the DOM manipulation and how I can use Javascript to achieve a great experience.
